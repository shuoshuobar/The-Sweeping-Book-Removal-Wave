# Pulled off School Bookshelves: the Sweeping Book Removal Wave

## Goal:
Analyze and visualize the situation of book ban across the United States.

## Findings:
The past academic year has seen an unprecedented surge in book bans, reaching the 10,000 plus springboard for the first time, a significant jump from the 3,362 records of the previous year. State-wise, Florida and Iowa turned out with the most bans in the 2023-2024 school year. Book bans in these two states reeled from state legislation, taking together effect with initiatives from local districts. 

## Process of Data Collection:
Download the Index of School Book Bans datasets of the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years from PEN America: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas](https://pen.org/book-bans/pen-america-index-of-school-book-bans-2023-2024/.
   
## Process of Data Analysis:
1. Filter the top ten banned book titles of the three school years and research their subject matter.
2. Set up a treemap to visualize the division of the subject matter among top ten banned book titles from 2021 to 2024
3. Create a dataframe documenting the number of banned book instances by state and school year.
4. Map the instances of book bans by state in 2023-2024 using DataWrapper

## Skills/Approaches in Use:
1. Excel - data collection
2. Python - Pandas: data cleaning and analyzing
3. Python - Treemap making
4. DataWrapper: map plotting
5. HTML: Webpage with scrollytelling style

## Looking Ahead:
1. Chart Type Selection: I'm still thinking about how to better visualize the 7 racial groups on one chart or fewer charts to create a more digestable, side-by-side comparison of their low food access population change from 2015 to 2019.
2. Consideration of Other Variables: If I had more time, it would be interesting to take households' access to vehicles into account as well and see how it works with distance in miles to affect racial groups.
3. Research: Search for policies/subsidies in 2015 and 2019 to better understand possible reasons for the still worse low food access situation for Black or African Americans and better situation for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and American Indians or Alaska Natives.
